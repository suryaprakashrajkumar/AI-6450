## 2.1 Dataset Description and Justification

### Dataset summary

This project uses a procedurally generated dataset of 2-D grid navigation environments created using a custom Python simulator.

### Dataset contents

Each record corresponds to a single navigation decision step (state-action pair).

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `local_patch` | Binary occupancy grid patch centered on the agent (`1=obstacle`, `0=free`) |
| `relative_goal` | Relative direction and normalized displacement to the goal (`dr`, `dc`) |
| `agent_position` | Agent grid coordinates `[row, col]` |
| `action_id` | Expert next move from A* planner (classification label, 8 classes) |
| `cost_to_goal` | Remaining optimal path cost from current state (regression label) |

### Labels

- **Classification:** next movement direction (8 classes)
- **Regression:** optimal cost-to-goal

### Why this dataset is appropriate

Synthetic data generation is appropriate for this project because it provides:

1. **Exact optimal labels** from A* for both action and cost supervision.
2. **Scalable data production** to generate tens of thousands of samples quickly.
3. **Controlled distribution shifts** by varying map type, obstacle settings, and start-goal distance.
4. **Reproducibility** via fixed seeds and deterministic generation settings.

These properties are essential for fair comparison of planning-based and learning-based navigation methods.

### Data collection plan

Data is generated by:

1. Generating grid maps (`random` or `maze`).
2. Sampling valid start-goal pairs.
3. Running A* to compute the optimal path.
4. Recording each step along the trajectory as a supervised sample.

**Tools:** Python, NumPy, and a custom A* implementation.

### Expected dataset size

Target size is **50,000–150,000** step-level samples per dataset version, with baseline results produced in the next milestone.
